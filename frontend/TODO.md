# TODO
My personal remaining TODO.

## Required:
- Create way to call PokéAPI
- Implement caching
- Populate search results with real data from PokéAPI
- Populate Pokémon page with real data from PokéAPI

## Bonus:
- Change debug navbar into breadcrumb that remembers search term while viewing Pokémon
- Add icons of Pokémon to history dropdown
- Allow the user to remove history entries with an "X" button, like exists in the searchbar
- Implement evolution viewing
- Implement automated unit testing for business functionality
- Implement localization
- Make the app look like a Pokédex
- Make the "history" dropdown display a list of possible Pokémon names (given the current input) instead of the history once the user has started typing something
