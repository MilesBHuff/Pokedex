# TODO
My personal remaining TODO.
(*Italics* are not in the prompt.)

## Required:
- In the ReadMe, explain what changes might be needed if this app were intended to be run in a "concurrent" environment.
- Populate Pokémon page with real data from PokéAPI
- *Add return types to all function signatures*

## Bonus:
- *Add information about how to run the application to the ReadMe*
- Implement evolution viewing
- *When visiting a search page, add it to the search history.  (useful for when people visit from a bookmark)*
- *Change debug navbar into breadcrumb that remembers search term while viewing Pokémon*
- *Allow the user to remove history entries with an "X" button, like exists in the searchbar*
- *Get display names for the search results page*
- *Display icons and other Pokémon-specific information on the search results page*
- *Add icons of Pokémon to history dropdown, if a given name is a perfect match for only one Pokémon*
- *Implement localization*

## Not doing:
- *Add animations to make the site flow*
- *Make the "history" dropdown display a list of possible Pokémon names (given the current input) instead of the history once the user has started typing something*
- Implement automated unit testing for business functionality
- Make the app look like a Pokédex
