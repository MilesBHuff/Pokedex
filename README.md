# Unofficial Pokédex

A web application that displays data on Pokémon from the [PokéAPI](https://PokeAPI.co).  
(This project exists solely to demonstrate my abilities to a particular hiring authority.)  

## About

### Linting

I made the TSC about as strict as possible (minus a couple ridiculous things and a couple checks that I feel do not belong in a compiler).

I used ESLint with recommended settings for this project, and tweaked it as necessary to get good behavior.  I would like to eventually make my own ESLintRC from scratch again.  The last one I made, I made on my work laptop during work hours for my last job;  so I unfortunately no longer have access to it.

I used VSCode's built-in formatter because I don't like how Prettier (which comes with vite-template-redux) does things.  It would be nice for all my projects to eventually have a commandline equivalent to what VSCode does.  It's been on my ToDo list for "eventually", and I'll eventually get around to it.

### Theme and artwork

The primary accent color, `#DF2F2F`, is inspired by the red used in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) when placed against either white or black, as well as to have about the same contrast ratio for both.  

The secondary accent color, `#757575`, is inspired by the grey band in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet the same contrast criteria as the primary accent color.  

Both colors are used in the Pokéball favicon, which I created from scratch for this project.
