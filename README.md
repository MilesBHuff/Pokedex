# Pokédex

A simple Pokédex web-app meant to demonstrate my abilities to a hiring authority.

## About the theme and artwork

The primary accent color, `#DF2F2F`, is inspired by the red used in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet WCAG AA when placed against either white or black, as well as to have about the same contrast ratio for both.

The secondary accent color, `#757575`, is inspired by the grey band in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet the same contrast criteria as the primary accent color.

Both colors are used in the Pokéball favicon, which I created from scratch for this project.
