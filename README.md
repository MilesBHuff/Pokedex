# Unofficial Pokédex

A web application that displays data on Pokémon from the [PokéAPI](https://PokeAPI.co).  
(This project exists solely to demonstrate my abilities to a particular hiring authority.)  

## About

### Theme and artwork

The primary accent color, `#DF2F2F`, is inspired by the red used in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) when placed against either white or black, as well as to have about the same contrast ratio for both.  

The secondary accent color, `#757575`, is inspired by the grey band in Pokéballs, and is designed to meet the same contrast criteria as the primary accent color.  

Both colors are used in the Pokéball favicon, which I created from scratch for this project.
